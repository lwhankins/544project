      Planning for retirement is one of the most important things adults can do to ensure their lasting financial security. 
      Unfortunately, the myriad of retirement account types, each with their own benefits, drawbacks and stipulations make this an unnecessarily complicated decision.
      Lack of information on these accounts in education or in the general conversation makes optimized or even adequate financial planning feel inaccessible.
      To help you pick a retirement account or combination of retirement accounts best suited to your financial goals, we have consolidated the primary account types here.
      Our calculator will take the contributions amount(s) and account type(s) you have selected and display how much you will have available each month when you retire.

        <h3>Basic Info</h3>
        Let's start with where you are and how long of a retirement you'd like. Starting to contribute to these accounts earlier will give more time for your accounts to grow, while retiring later will 
        leave you with more money per month in retirement. You may want to retire early and that's okay too. Let's see how you can make sure you'll have the lifestyle you want in retirement. <br>

        <h4> Account Types</h4>
        Now you get to select which kinds of retirement accounts you'd like to contribute to. Each has their own benefits and drawbacks, which are detailed in the account dropdown. If this is your first time
        dipping your toe in financial planning, starting with a 401k and an IRA is a good baseline, especially if your employer will match some of your contributions to your 401k.
